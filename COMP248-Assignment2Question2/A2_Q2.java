// Description of the program:
// This program calculates the index of a particular month and market, both of which are inputted by the user.
// This program contains specific percentage of harvests for every month of the year for both the domestic and international markets.
// This program additionally outputs error messages if it fails to understand the user's inputs.
// This program is also case-insensitive, meaning that it will be able to read any variation of upper-case and lower-case input of a month and market name.

	public static void main(String[] args)

		// Initialize the scanner to read user input.
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// Initialize the constant variable W, which will be used to calculate the index.
		final double W = 1.4672;
		
		// Initialize a variable which will later contain the percentage of the harvest.
		double P = 0;
		
		// Display the welcome message when running the program.
		System.out.println("Welcome to Farms Distribution Center Price Index Program:");
		System.out.println("=========================================================");
		
		// Prompt the user to enter then name of a Month and Market, respectively.
		System.out.print("\nPlease enter a Month and Market, respectively: ");
		
		// Initialize two variables containing the name of the month and market
		String month = in.next();
		String market = in.next();
		
		// Turn both the inputted month and market into strings containing only lowercase letters.
		month = month.toLowerCase();
		market = market.toLowerCase();
		
		// We use two switch statements, the first one to verify which market the user would like to obtain a percentage from.
		// The second switch statement, located inside the first switch statement, checks for the month.
		// Both switch statements contain error messages if the user fails to enter a correct market or month.
