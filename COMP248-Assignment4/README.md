The Fund class represents the funds available in a household budget. It has instance variables for different types of money (loonies, toonies, fives, tens, twenties) and methods to add funds, calculate the total value of the fund, and obtain a formatted breakdown of the fund.

The Expense class represents an expense made in the household budget. It has instance variables for the type of expense, amount, business name, and due date. It also has methods to obtain a formatted string representation of the expense and check if two expenses are equal.

The HouseholdBudget class brings together the Fund and Expense classes to manage the household budget. It has instance variables for a Fund object and an array of Expense objects. It provides methods to compare the fund value and breakdown of two HouseholdBudget objects, get the total fund value, and get the number of expenses.

To use these classes, you can create objects of Fund, Expense, and HouseholdBudget classes and invoke their respective methods as needed. You can also interact with these objects using user input or perform operations based on specific requirements.

If you have any specific questions about using these classes or need further assistance, please let me know.
