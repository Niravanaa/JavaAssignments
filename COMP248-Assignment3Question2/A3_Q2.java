// Description of the program:
// The SEVS program is a program that enables a user to input candidates' names and IDs.
// The user can display their entered list of candidates.
// The user can vote for any candidate an unlimited number of times.
// The user can add another sequence of candidates' names and IDs.
// The user can display a ranking of the candidates based on their number of votes.
