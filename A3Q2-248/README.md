# Simple Electronic Voting System (SEVS)

It allows the user to input candidates' names and IDs, display the entered list of candidates, vote for candidates, add new candidates, and display the ranking of candidates based on the number of votes they received.

Here is a breakdown of the program's structure and functionality:

    The program starts by displaying a welcome message and asking the user to enter a string collection of electoral candidates.
    The user is then presented with a menu of options, each corresponding to a specific task.
    The program reads the user's input code and validates it.
    The program uses a switch statement to perform the selected task based on the input code.
        Code 1: Displays the list of candidates with their IDs and names in a formatted table.
        Code 2: Allows the user to vote for a candidate by entering their ID.
        Code 3: Enables the user to add a new sequence of candidates' names and IDs.
        Code 4: Displays a ranking table of candidates based on the number of votes received.
        Code 0: Exits the program.
    The program continues to prompt the user for input codes until the code entered is 0, at which point it terminates.

The code includes comments that provide explanations and descriptions of the program's functionalities, making it easier to understand and follow. However, the code you provided seems to be incomplete, as it ends abruptly with an ellipsis ("...").

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with a particular aspect of the code, please let me know.
