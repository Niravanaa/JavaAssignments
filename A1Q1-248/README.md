# Simple 3D-Space Program

This repository contains a Java program that computes and outputs the Cartesian coordinates of an astronomical object based on given input values. It also calculates and displays the Cartesian coordinates of the nearest astronomical object.
## A1_Q1.java

This file implements the Simple 3D-Space Program. It includes the following features:

1. Initializes constants for coordinate calculations such as PI and E.
2. Prompts the user to enter two values, p and q.
3. Uses empirical formulas to calculate the x, y, and z coordinates of the first astronomical object.
4. Displays the calculated Cartesian coordinates of the first object.
5. Uses the calculated coordinates to obtain the Cartesian coordinates of the nearest object.
6. Displays the Cartesian coordinates of the nearest object.
7. Provides a welcome message and an exit message.

## Usage

To use this program, you can follow these steps:

1. Compile the A1_Q1.java file using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled Java program.
3. Enter the values for 'p' and 'q' as prompted by the program.
4. The program will calculate and display the Cartesian coordinates of the first object.
5. It will then compute and display the Cartesian coordinates of the nearest object.
6. Finally, the program will display a thank you message.

Make sure you have Java installed on your system to run the program.
