# Java Assignments/Projects
A repository containing projects and assignments that are coded in the Java programming language.

## Description

The JavaAssignments repository is a collection of projects and assignments that I have written in the Java programming language. This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing Java programming concepts.

## Projects

The repository includes various Java projects and assignments organized in separate directories. Each project or assignment is accompanied by a detailed README file providing information about the project and instructions on how to run and use it.

Here is a list of some of the projects and assignments available in this repository:

| Name | Description |
| :-: | --- |
| A1Q1-248 | This program primarily explores the computation of Cartesian coordinates for astronomical objects based on given formulas and constants, and calculates the coordinates of the nearest object. |
| A1Q2-248 | This program primarily explores the conversion of temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit units using empirical formulas, and performs additional calculations based on the transformed values. |
| A2Q1-248 | This program primarily explores the use of conditional statements (switch case and if statements) to match user input with specific recycling codes, and provides corresponding instructions for recycling different items. |
| A2Q2-248 | This program primarily explores the use of switch statements and string manipulation to calculate and display a price index based on user input of a month and market, with error handling for invalid inputs. |
| A3Q1-248 | This program primarily explores string manipulation and conditional statements to encrypt or decrypt a user-inputted message by flipping pairs of characters based on the length of the message. |
| A3Q2-248 | This Java program is a simple electronic voting system (SEVS) that allows a user to perform various operations such as entering candidates' names and IDs, displaying the candidate list, voting for a candidate, adding new candidates, and displaying the ranking of candidates based on the number of votes. |
| A4-248 | The program is a driver class that explores the functionalities of a HouseholdBudget application, allowing users to manage budget funds, expenses, and perform various operations on multiple budget instances. |

Feel free to explore the directories and choose the project or assignment that interests you.
