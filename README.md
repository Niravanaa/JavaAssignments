# Java Assignments/Projects
A repository containing projects and assignments that are coded in the Java programming language.

## Description

The JavaAssignments repository is a collection of projects and assignments that I have written in the Java programming language. This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing Java programming concepts.

## Projects

The repository includes various Java projects and assignments organized in separate directories. Each project or assignment is accompanied by a detailed README file providing information about the project and instructions on how to run and use it.

Here is a list of some of the projects and assignments available in this repository:

| Name | Description |
| :-: | --- |
| [A1Q1-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment1Question1) | This program primarily explores the computation of Cartesian coordinates for astronomical objects based on given formulas and constants, and calculates the coordinates of the nearest object. |
| [A1Q2-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment1Question2) | This program primarily explores the conversion of temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit units using empirical formulas, and performs additional calculations based on the transformed values. |
| [A2Q1-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment2Question1) | This program primarily explores the use of conditional statements (switch case and if statements) to match user input with specific recycling codes, and provides corresponding instructions for recycling different items. |
| [A2Q2-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment2Question2) | This program primarily explores the use of switch statements and string manipulation to calculate and display a price index based on user input of a month and market, with error handling for invalid inputs. |
| [A3Q1-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment3Question1) | This program primarily explores string manipulation and conditional statements to encrypt or decrypt a user-inputted message by flipping pairs of characters based on the length of the message. |
| [A3Q2-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment3Question2) | This Java program is a simple electronic voting system (SEVS) that allows a user to perform various operations such as entering candidates' names and IDs, displaying the candidate list, voting for a candidate, adding new candidates, and displaying the ranking of candidates based on the number of votes. |
| [A4-248](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP248-Assignment4) | The program is a driver class that explores the functionalities of a HouseholdBudget application, allowing users to manage budget funds, expenses, and perform various operations on multiple budget instances. |
| [A1-249](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP249-Assignment1) | The program is a simple Snakes and Ladders game that can be played with two players and can randomly generate snake and ladder positions, randomly roll a dice, and automatically move the players while displaying the board's contents. |
| [A2-249](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP249-Assignment2) | This Java program is a transportation system project that consists of two parts, where Part 1 explores functionality related to finding least and most expensive aircraft objects and testing various transportation classes, while Part 2 focuses on copying an array of transportation objects correctly without explicitly determining the object types. |
| [A3-249](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP249-Assignment3) | This Java program is a book record management system that explores syntax checking, semantic validation, and interactive navigation functionalities to create, validate, store, and navigate through book records in a structured manner. |
| [A4-249](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP249-Assignment4) | This Java program implements a book management system that explores the creation, manipulation, and organization of book records using classes like Book and BookList, providing functionalities such as adding, displaying, storing, deleting, and modifying book records. |
| [A1-352](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP352-Assignment1) | This Java program explores the recursive calculation of the Fibonacci sequence, examining the impact of memory usage and runtime complexity on larger input values. |
| [A2-352](https://github.com/Niravanaa/JavaAssignments/tree/main/COMP352-Assignment2) | This Java program primarily explores a sorting algorithm that utilizes reversals and the identification of runs of length 3 to optimize the sorting process, while also measuring the number of reversals, comparisons, and swaps performed. |

Feel free to explore the directories and choose the project or assignment that interests you.
